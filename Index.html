            A map has 4 different types of information which you can set parameters by selecting a gear icon at the top right corner.

            <li><p><strong>Paragliding sites:</strong>
              The site is shown on a map after at least one flight have been made and uploaded to the server. (Sometimes new sites take a bit longer than an instant to appear on the map and the reasons differ so be patient.)
              You can choose how many spots are visible by choosing minimum flights in settings <code>lower value = slower loading & higher value = faster loading</code>
              When clicking on a dot and then clicking again on a name of takeoff you can open sub-menu where you see all publicly visible flights from this take-off site. There is also a hiker icon when selected, shows hike paths to the takeoff site recorded by different people (Not all sites have hike paths so we highly encourage everyone to participate in hiking and then upload their hike tracks to flysafe so the others won't get lost) You can easily follow these hiking tracks by firsly position yourself on the map by clicking crosshairs icon on the upper right corner of the map and then simply follow the trail.
              <code class="note">NOTE!</code> that your hike should end in radius of 100m of the takeoff site to be shown in hike track for this site.

          <p>Flysafe app also has its own inbuilt chat. By default, you already have one chat group with your national flag. In this group are all the pilots which are flying under this flag. <em>Some nations have a lot of pilots and it would be inappropriate to chat about everyday stuff in this nationwide groups</em>. That's why you have an option to create your own group. And by doing so, select <strong>"new conversation"</strong>,  then check <strong>"make a new group conversation"</strong>, when you select at least two users, a button <strong>"new group"</strong> appears. Click it when done selecting members. Now you see an empty chat with the title of (names of all members in this group) You can change this title for better visibility and sorting. You can also add members later.</p>
          <p>Now if you type something in, all members you select will receive this message if they have Flysafe app installed. You can also share your location with everyone in this group. If some group is too chatty you can mute it with the bell icon.
          To remove some chat from the main screen you can archive it and will be hidden and can be viewed in <strong>"show archived"</strong> menu.</p>
          <p>If you want to chat with only one person just select "New conversation" and select a person you wish to chat with.</p>

            <p><em>FlySafe is a hobby project intended for free-flying enthusiasts. It is a mobile and web application for flight logging and location sharing between pilots.</em></p>

            <h4>Privacy policy</h4>
            
            <h5>What data is being collected?</h5>
              <p>The most common piece of information on FlySafe is location. This may be public (location point from your public flight logs) or private (your last known location when using FlySafe's friend location feature). On top of that we store your e-mail address for logging in the system and optionally your phone number, gender and country if you enter this information in your profile.</p>
            
            <h5>Who is collecting the data?</h5>
              <p>We, the developers of FlySafe get data from you and we store it on a single server. No third party has access direct access to the data or server. We gather some of the publicly available information (like flights and user names) from other Online Contests (OLC).</p>
            
            <h5>How is the data being collected?</h5>
              <p>When you log in to FlySafe you enter your e-mail as your username (or choose a Google account e-mail). If you log in to the mobile app, the app asks you for your country, gender and phone number - you choose to enter this manually or skip it. One of the most important and useful features of FlySafe is an "always on" location sharing between friends. If you have any friends that you share your location with them, then the mobile app periodically sends your last known location (about once per hour). Your location data stored on the server is encrypted with a public key for each of your friends that your share your location with, generated by the app and can only be decrypted with your friend's private key. This means that even though the last known location is stored on a central server, it can't be viewed by anyone else other than the people you allow.</p>
            
            <h5>Will the data be shared with any third parties?</h5>
              <p>We do not forward your data to a third party unless you choose to use a feature that shares any of your private data with other people. This means that when you share your location with the people you choose, we forward your last known location to these users. Any of the public data (public flights and user profiles) may be accessed and collected by a third party - like search engines and website archivers.</p>
            
            <h5>How will the information be used?</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>E-mail:</strong> is used for logging in the system. We don't send newsletters. You will only get an e-mail from us if you forget your password.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Country:</strong> is used for filtering daily flights and text localization.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Gender:</strong> is used for generating personalized notifications with gender-specific text.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Phone number:</strong> is used for emergency SMS location sharing. Works only if you have SMS location sharing enabled in the app and only with the people you choose.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p><strong>For example:</strong> Your friend on FlySafe doesn't have your phone number, but you have shared your location with him/her. Your friend can then get your phone number from FlySafe and send you an SMS from the app, that looks like this:</p>
              <code>#FlySafe 1234 abcdef12345 GPS</code> 
              <p>On your end when the FlySafe app receives this message it will automatically reply with your coordinates.</p>
            
            <h5>How long will the data be stored for?</h5>
              <p>Your account info (e-mail address and your flights) are stored until they are deleted by you or us, and your last known location expires in a month. You can edit or delete your flights, country and phone number any time in your profile.<p>
            
            <h5>What rights does the data subject have?</h5>
              <p>You are in control of your data. You can edit or delete any information on your profile, however to permanetely delete your account you need to reach us by e-mail.<p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>To delete your last known location data:</strong> Select from the mobile app menu: Location sharing > menu > delete my last known location.</li>
              <li><strong>To delete your phone number:</strong> Edit your profile in the app and save your profile with an empty phone number.</li>
              <li><strong>To delete your flights:</strong> Click on edit flight, then choose delete and save.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>How can the data subject raise a complaint?</h5>
              <p>If you have any questions or wish to permanetely delete your account, send us an e-mail at <code>[flysaf(at)klv.si]</code></p>
